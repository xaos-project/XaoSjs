# Try It

[Try the live demo!](http://xaos-project.github.io/XaoSjs/) Using XaoSjs is simple. Left click to zoom in; right click to zoom out.  Works best in Chrome, acceptably in Firefox, and I make no guarantees about anything else.

# About

XaoS.js is a real-time fractal zoomer in a Web Browser.  Instead of drawing a box and waiting for the fractal
to re-draw, it allows you to dive into the fractal in realtime.

This is a JavaScript adaptation of the
[Hubicka algorithm](https://github.com/xaos-project/XaoS/wiki/Developer's-Guide#algorithms)
from [XaoS](http://xaos.sf.net). The zooming code was adapted from Java by way of
[NextFractal](https://nextbreakpoint.com/nextfractal.html) (previously JAME).
